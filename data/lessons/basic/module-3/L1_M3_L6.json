                "Tip 1: Group irregular verbs by their patterns. For example, make a list of verbs where all three forms are the same (cut, put, set, hit) or where V2 and V3 are the same (buy-bought, teach-taught).",
                "Tip 2: Create flashcards. Write the V1 form on one side and the V2 and V3 forms on the other. Test yourself regularly.",
                "Tip 3: Read a lot in English. When you read books, newspapers, or stories, pay attention to how different verb forms are used in sentences. This will help you understand them in context.",
                "Tip 4: Practice writing sentences. Take a verb and try to write three different sentences using its V1, V2, and V3 forms correctly.",
                "Tip 5: Focus on the most common irregular verbs first. You don't need to learn all of them at once. Verbs like 'be', 'have', 'do', 'go', 'say', 'get', 'make', 'know', and 'see' are very important.",
                "Tip 6: Say the verb forms out loud. Saying 'speak, spoke, spoken' or 'break, broke, broken' repeatedly can help you remember the sounds and patterns.",
                "Tip 7: Remember the tense rules. V2 (Past Simple) is used alone for past actions. V3 (Past Participle) is always used with a helping verb like 'have', 'has', 'had', 'is', 'are', 'was', or 'were'."
