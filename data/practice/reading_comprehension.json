During his exams, he realized that he had wasted precious days in unnecessary activities. His grades fell, and he regretted his choices. From that day, Ravi decided to manage his time wisely, understanding that time once lost never returns. The experience taught him the importance of discipline and time management in achieving success. He began maintaining a schedule and allocating specific hours for study, play, and rest.
