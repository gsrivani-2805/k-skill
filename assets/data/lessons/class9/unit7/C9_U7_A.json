      "content": "Joan of Arc, born in 1412, was a French peasant girl who claimed that the 'voices' of saints had told her she was called on by God to aid her country. This French national heroine took to the field of battle during the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453). At the time, the desperate French army had suffered a number of losses to the English, but Joan brought renewed confidence by lifting the siege of Orleans in nine days and taking back the city of Reims. She was soon captured by the English. Joan of Arc, who had been caught by the British in the war, was imprisoned and presented before the court."

These plays were about political themes and issues concerning poverty and women's rights. He wrote 'Man and Superman' (1902), 'John Bull's Other Island' (1904) and 'Major Barbara' (1905). In 1914 he wrote 'Saint Joan', which is considered to be one of his masterpieces. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1925. Shaw wrote over 50 plays during his literary career. Right until the time of his death on November 2, 1950, Shaw remained committed to the socialist cause."
