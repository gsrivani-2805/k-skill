                "Tip 1: Listen, Don't Look. Rhyme is about sound, not spelling. The words 'blue' and 'flew' rhyme, but are spelled differently. The words 'rough' and 'through' are spelled similarly at the end, but they do not rhyme.",
                "Tip 2: Say the words out loud. Hearing the words is the best way to check if they rhyme. If the ending sounds are the same, they rhyme.",
                "Tip 3: Think in word families. If you need a word that rhymes with 'cat', think of other words in the '-at' family like 'bat', 'hat', 'mat'.",
                "Tip 4: Read simple poems and listen to songs in English. Pay attention to the words at the end of the lines to find the rhyming pairs.",
                "Tip 5: Play rhyming games. Say a word like 'sun' and have a friend say a word that rhymes with it, like 'fun' or 'run'.",
                "Tip 6: Make your own simple two-line poems. This is a fun way to practice. For example: 'The sky is blue, / I like it, do you?'",
                "Tip 7: Use a rhyming dictionary. If you are writing a poem and get stuck, you can look up a word in an online rhyming dictionary to find many words that rhyme with it."
