                "Tip 1: Use 'than' with the Comparative Degree. When you compare two things, the word 'than' is used after the comparative adjective. Example: 'He is stronger than his brother.'",
                "Tip 2: Use 'the' before the Superlative Degree. The superlative degree is almost always preceded by the article 'the'. Example: 'She is the smartest student in the class.'",
                "Tip 3: Never use a double comparative or superlative. Do not say 'more taller' or 'most tallest'. This is a common mistake. Just say 'taller' and 'tallest'. Similarly, don't say 'more better'; 'better' is already a comparative.",
                "Tip 4: Counting syllables can help. A syllable is a unit of pronunciation having one vowel sound. 'Big' has one syllable. 'Ha-ppy' has two. 'Beau-ti-ful' has three. This helps you decide whether to use '-er/-est' or 'more/most'.",
                "Tip 5: Practice by comparing things around you. Look at two trees and say, 'This tree is taller than that tree.' Look at all the students in your class and think, 'Who is the tallest student?'",
                "Tip 6: Using 'Elder' and 'Eldest'. 'Elder' and 'eldest' are used only for people (usually within a family), and they cannot be followed by 'than'. 'Older' and 'oldest' can be used for both people and things. Example: 'My elder brother is a doctor.' (Correct) 'He is elder than me.' (Incorrect - use 'older than me')."
