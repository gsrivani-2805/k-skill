Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach trees that in the springtime broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them... Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in MY garden... but one day I came back. I had been to visit my friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over, I had said all that I had to say, and I determined to return to my own castle. When I arrived, I saw children playing in MY garden."
