      "line": "It has been wonderful. I was lucky that the Hyderabad Cricket Association promoted me and Zaki (Syed Moinuddin Zaki) from the under-16 level itself. They made us play in the under-19 grade the same year. It was a huge leap for us and very encouraging. Fortunately, by 18, I was on the verge of playing for Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy. Honestly, I feel that all the hard work and commitment I put in from the start of my career have culminated in 16 long years of international cricket. It has been an immensely satisfying feeling to have contributed to Indian cricket in my own way."

Though there was always the dream to play for my country, I also had a natural desire to be a doctor, coming from a family of doctors. Luckily, my father gave me the complete freedom to choose any one of the two. Here the role of my uncle Baba Mohan was very crucial along with some of the coaches then."

      "line": "There were many. But some stand out. Though I never played the World Cup that saw India as the No.1 team, being a member of the Indian team which was the world No.1 in Test cricket was one of them. The 281 against the Aussies in Kolkata in 2001 was another. That Test remains the most memorable match for me. In fact, that Test series was very special for all the players for it was also the best and the most memorable series. That series gave us the confidence that we can be the best. Clearly, that was the turning point of Indian cricket itself."

I feel lucky to have played under Sourav, my first captain Sachin and M.S (Dhoni). They all led by example. Everyone was a true performer and all of them had traits of leadership."

For, it was then that we started doing well consistently, especially abroad.
