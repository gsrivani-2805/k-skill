                "Tip 1: Learn in Pairs. When you learn a new word like 'brave', make an effort to find and learn its antonym, 'cowardly', at the same time.",
                "Tip 2: Use Them in Sentences. The best way to remember antonyms is to use them together in a sentence that shows contrast, like: 'The test was not easy; it was quite difficult.'",
                "Tip 3: Look for Prefixes. Many antonyms are formed by adding a prefix like 'un-', 'in-', 'im-', 'ir-', or 'dis-'. For example: happy/unhappy, possible/impossible, agree/disagree, regular/irregular.",
                "Tip 4: Create Flashcards. Write a word on one side of a small card and its antonym on the other. This is a great way to test yourself.",
                "Tip 5: Read Actively. While reading, notice how authors use opposite words to make their writing more powerful and clear. When you see a word, try to think of its antonym.",
                "Tip 6: Play Word Games. Games like crosswords, word association, or online quizzes can be a fun and engaging way to practice your knowledge of antonyms."
