I got my admission letter but my aunt tore it up. Then I decided that I wanted to join the police force. My mother said, \"Don't join the police force, just do your graduation!\" So I went to Jai Hind College in Bombay. There, I was to take either French or German. Though I had studied French for seven years, I did not know seven words of French. So I took German. Then my German teacher died. The college told me that I could change the college or take French. Now, who would give me admission in another college? I had got admission to Jai Hind by influence. So I thought, 'Okay, I will take French' and I started learning French again. I learnt it from my cousin. She was an architect's wife. I was going to the architect's office to learn French!"

      "line": "Actually, it all happened quite by chance. In the architect's office, I saw somebody drawing a window details. A window detail is very advanced drawing. I told him that his drawing was wrong- he would not open. He then had a bet with me and later he found that indeed, his drawing was wrong! My cousin's husband was surprised. He asked me to draw a few specific things, which I immediately did. He asked me to design a house and I designed a house. After that, he told me to drop every thing and join architecture. We went to meet the Principal of the college. The Principal warned me, \"I will allow you to take part in the entrance exams, but if you do not do well I will not allow you to join.\" I got an 'A+' in the entrance exam and from that day it was a cakewalk. I had never made a plan, but I knew how something looked like, from the top. I had never known what a section was, but I knew if you cut a plan what it would look like. I stood first in class, first throughout after that. I believe that all this understanding came from what I used to play and do during school. I had a friend called Behram Divecha. We used to have competitions between us for designing forts, guns and ammunition. Each of us would design something in an effort to be different. In school, when I was in the second or third standard, one of my teachers, Mrs Gupta, saw my sketches and told me, \"See, you are useless in every thing else but your sketches are good. When you grow up, you will become an architect\". I did not know at the time but she was right. Later, after I became an architect, I went back to meet her and told her."

I would be thinking about the flow of water within the dam and how much of water the dam would be able to hold. That was my interest for the day. When students lost a button while playing or fighting, they would come running to me and I would cut a button for them from chalk, using a blade. Discipline in the school was very important and no student could afford to have a button missing. The student would get past dinner with a full neat uniform and after that it did not matter."
