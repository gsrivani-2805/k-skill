It feels like ages since we last met, and I wanted to tell you about what’s happening here in our village.\n\nLife here is good. The monsoon rains have been good this year, and our paddy fields are looking green and beautiful. Father says the harvest will be great. Yesterday, we had a small village fair. It was fun! There were many stalls with sweets and toys, and a puppet show. I bought a small flute for my younger sister. She was so happy.\n\nI also helped my mother with the farming work for a few days. It was hard work under the hot sun, but it felt good to help. I also saw a new type of bird near the river. It had blue feathers and sang a beautiful song. I wish you were here to see it.\n\nWhat about you? How is your new school in the city? Are you making new friends? I hope you are enjoying your studies. Did you visit your grandparents this summer? Do write back and tell me everything.\n\nWell, that’s all for now. I hope to see you during the Diwali holidays. Give my regards to your parents.\n\nWith love,\n\nSunil"

I'm so excited to tell you about the upcoming Village Harvest Festival next month. You remember how much fun we had last year, right? I really hope you can come this time too.\n\nThe festival starts on August 15th and will last for three days. There will be traditional dances, folk songs, and delicious food stalls with local dishes. This year, they are also planning a bullock cart race! It will be very exciting. My grandmother is making her special laddus, and you know how much you love them.\n\nMy parents would be very happy if you could stay with us. We can visit the temple, swim in the clean river, and play hide-and-seek in the fields, just like old times. All our old friends from school will also be here. It would be wonderful to see everyone together.\n\nPlease try your best to come. Let me know when you can arrive so I can tell my parents. I am eagerly waiting for your reply.\n\nLots of love,\n\nAnjali"
