        "Where words come out from the depth of truth,",
        "Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;",

        "has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;",

        "into ever-widening thought and action",
        "Into that Heaven of freedom",
        "My Father, let my country awake."
