        "Standing among silent commuters in the yellow light",
        "suburbs slid past his unseeing eyes",
        "His shirt and pants are soggy and his black raincoat",
        "Stained with mud and his bag stuffed with books",
        "Is falling apart. His eyes dimmed by age",
        "fade homeward through the humid monsoon night.",
        "Now I can see him getting off the train"

        "Like a word dropped from a long sentence.",
        "He hurries across the length of the grey platform,",
        "Crosses the railway line, enters the lane,",
        "His chappals are sticky with mud, but he hurries onward."

        "Home again, I see him drinking weak tea,",
        "Eating a stale chapati, reading a book.",
        "He goes into the toilet to contemplate",
        "Man’s estrangement from a man-made world.",
        "Coming out he trembles at the sink,",
        "The cold water running over his brown hands,",
        "A few droplets cling to the greying hairs on his wrists.",
        "His sullen children have often refused to share",
        "Jokes and secrets with him. He will now go to sleep",
        "Listening to the static on the radio, dreaming",
        "Of his ancestors and grandchildren, thinking",
        "Of nomads entering a subcontinent through a narrow pass."
