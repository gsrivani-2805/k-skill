        "We, Indians, are proud to be a strong nation,",
        "our roots, we declare, cannot be shaken.",
        "Then why these fights,",
        "which leave us in poor plight?",
        "Irrespective of our region,",
        "forget the castes,",
        "which makes us lose our charm.",
        "Let's ignore the selfish call of each region,",
        "and listen for once to the call of the nation.",
        "Why do we spend our time bickering",
        "when so many tasks need finishing?",
        "Don't we have better things to do",
        "than indulge in creating problems anew?",
        "Is all this violence needed",
        "with the people being cheated?",
        "Who will return this only son",
        "whom she loves a ton?",
        "Who will bring back his brother",
        "whose ashes he is still to gather?",
        "Where has all the love gone",
        "which resided in the heart of all?",
        "There is no reason to be proud,",
        "and be on high cloud.",
        "We have to go a long way,",
        "we have to think seriously,",
        "else we end up miserably.",
        "Then let our minds throw out the rot,",
        "and devote our time to pious thoughts.",
        "Let us control the riots,",
        "which leave us with no choice,",
        "but to hang our heads in shame,",
        "and say we have miserably failed.",
        "We have the power to win,",
        "so why not end this din?",
        "Let us unite,",
        "and fight against those who incite.",
        "Let us not be misled,",
        "by those who want to see us dead.",
        "We are a strong united nation,",
        "all we need is a bit of dedication."
