      "category": "science",
      "paragraph": "The water cycle is how water moves around our planet. First, the sun heats water in oceans, rivers, and lakes, turning it into invisible water vapor that rises into the sky. This process is called evaporation. High in the sky, the water vapor cools down and forms tiny droplets that create clouds. This is called condensation. When the clouds become heavy with water, the droplets fall back to Earth as rain or snow. This is called precipitation. The water then flows back to rivers and oceans, and the cycle starts again.",
