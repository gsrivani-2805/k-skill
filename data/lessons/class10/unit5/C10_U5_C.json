        "Abandoned to the garbage bin,",

        "as foul smells comes into play,",

        "die in eerie silence of the night,",
        "\"An outcast of destiny\"",
        "Its labored breath",
        "racing in quick gasps",
        "forced lonely like crap",
        "with cyanosed lips",
        "sea-blue nose and finger-tips,",
        "Its tattered and torn dirty wrap",
        "make it shiver in freezing grasp.",
        "A filthy black cat",
        "edges on to the holed bin",
        "searching for easy rats",
        "And finds its food",
        "tearing at the babe's hair",
        "with their sharp teeth",
        "gnawing at its ears",
        "to complete their feed,",
        "As the cat jumps in",
        "with a screeching meow",
        "the rats let loose",
        "a clicking squeak",
        "A bloody chaos ensues,",
        "The only sin of the infant—",
        "BEING BORN."
