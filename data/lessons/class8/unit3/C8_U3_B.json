It sounded so sweet that I thought it must be the King's musicians passing by, but it was really only a little linnet bird singing outside my window. It was so long since I had heard a bird sing in my garden that it seemed to me to be the most beautiful music in the world."

      "line": "(The Giant jumps out of bed and looks out. Through a little hole in the wall the children have crept in, and are sitting in the branches of the trees.) In every tree I could see a little child. The trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still Winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. 'Climb up! Little boy', said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the little boy was too tiny. It was then that my heart melted."

I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever. I was really very sorry for what I had done. So I crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw me, they were so frightened that they all ran away and the garden became Winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see me coming. So I stole up behind him and took him gently in my hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round my neck, and kissed me. When the other children saw that they came running back, and with them came the Spring."

I have many beautiful flowers, but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all. (Getting up and looking out of the window)"

In the farthest corner of the garden... a tree covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches are all golden, and silver fruit hangs down from them, and what is this? Can it be? Oh! Can it be? He has come back! He has come back! (The Old Giant leaps down the stairs, into the snowy garden and to the grassy patch where the child is standing. When he draws close to the child and examines him, his face grows red with anger.) Who? Who hath dared to wound thee? Your hands. Your feet. Who hath dared to wound thee? Tell me, that I may take out my big sword and slay him."
