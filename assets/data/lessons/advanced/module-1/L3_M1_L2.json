                "Tip 1: Use the active voice most of the time. It makes your writing clear, direct, and strong. For example, \"The dog chased the squirrel\" is stronger than \"The squirrel was chased by the dog.\"",
                "Tip 2: Use the passive voice when the action is more important than the person who does the action. For example, \"The road was repaired last week.\" (Here, the repair is more important than who repaired it).",
                "Tip 3: Use the passive voice when the doer of the action (the agent) is unknown or unimportant. For example, \"My bicycle was stolen.\" (We don't know who stole it).",
                "Tip 4: The passive voice is often used in scientific reports, news reports, and formal notices to sound objective and impersonal. For example, \"The water was heated to 100 degrees Celsius.\"",
                "Tip 5: Remember the main structure for passive voice: Object + 'be' verb + Past Participle (V3) + 'by' + Subject.",
                "Tip 6: Always remember to change the main verb to its third form (Past Participle) in the passive voice. For example, write -> written, eat -> eaten, break -> broken.",
                "Tip 7: The 'by' phrase (which tells who did the action) can be left out if the doer is obvious, unknown, or unimportant. For example, \"English is spoken all over the world\" (instead of \"...by people\")."
